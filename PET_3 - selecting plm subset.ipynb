So you say your looking for a nice family dog.....have we got the dog for you!!!! Meet Conrad, a one year old, 35 lb, Basset hound mix who came to our rescue via Texas.  Conrad is the sweetest most loving dog, just a big bundle of hugs and kisses. Conrad is crate trained, leash trained, doing very well on his house training, We do tell people to expect accidents until he gets used to a new routine - he is recently neutered too. Conrad does well in the car but because he wants some affection, he should be securely tethered or crated! He's fine with other dogs, But has not been tested with cats. Conrad just really wants to be everyone's pal! Sturdy kids that don't mind getting bumped into would be just fine. Conrad loves to run in the yard and play ball. He does well at fetch, and bringing it back. So if doggie kisses and hugs are your thing, check Conrad out on our website, you won't be disappointed.  Conrad is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated, and tested neg. for heartworm. His adoption fee is $350  \",\n          \"Russell was found as a stray by a woman in Wildwood who said he had been coming around her home for over a week.  She tried to find his home, but no one claimed him, so he was surrendered to us.  He's gorgeous cat - seal point with pretty blue eyes.  He's settling in nicely and loves to attention from staff.  If you are looking for a beautiful Siamese baby, he might be the one for you!  He's available for show now :)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pid\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
